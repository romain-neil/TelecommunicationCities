/!\ Developping is starting, if you known how to make antenna or telephonic center for this mod, let me know at the mail bellow.

If you are pretty good at 3d modeling, you can see project for 3d models to see what to be done

Apparently, the author abandoned the project. I invite you to email me at tutosfaciles48 [@] yahoo.com (remove maybe curly braces) so I added you developer.

# Telecommunication for Cities: Skylines
Telecommunication Mod for Cities: Skylines. Adds telecommunication as an extra service. The mod implements phone and internet access.

## Gameplay:

The idea is that telecommunication is added as an extra city service. The level 1 buildings (Phone center and phone line) will be unlocked at an early level (Worth Village). The next level (Telecommunications Tower) will be unlocked with the "Boom Town" Milestone. The 3rd level includes the data center and DSL-line enabling internet access. It will be unlocked with the "Big Town" milestone and high density residential and office zones will require internet access. The last level (Broadband tower, fiberline) will be unlocked with the Big City milestone.
Access to a phone line or internet increases happiness and internet connection also provides a boost to high school and university education. 
All unlock milestones may be changed during development due to balance issues and are now only preliminary values.

#### If you are interested in contributing in the development of this mod just write a nice email to me and I might just add you as dev. Please be aware that this project is and always will be just for fun and is licensed under GPL 2.0.
